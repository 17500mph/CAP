Public Domain Aufs Tools Package
================================

Nigel Perry, Dec 90.

This package contains programs for use by users of the CAP aufs system.
Programs are provided to convert downloads direct into aufs files, handle
StuffIt archives and manage aufs files. Most programs are modified versions
of exisiting public domain utilites. To build just run make:

	make
		builds binaries in their own directories
	make install
		builds binaries & moves them to $(BIN), default
		/usr/local/cap. Also copies shell scripts to $(BIN).
	make format
		builds formatted versions of all the manual pages
		in the directory formatted.
	make clean
		cleans up .o files etc.
	make reallyclean
		as clean + wipes aufslib & formatted

Enjoy.
