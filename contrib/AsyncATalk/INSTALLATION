NOTE: This software currently only works in conjunction with a Webster
MultiPort Gateway or UAB from CAP 6.0. To install async appletalk using
UAB, read the UAB documentation  and follow steps 0, 2, 6, 7, 8 & 9 below.
YOU DON'T NEED TO RUN asyncad WITH UAB

To install for use with a hardware gateway
------------------------------------------

0. Read the file 'README' for an overview of the way Async Appletalk works.
1. Compile and install async and asyncad (eg: in /usr/local/cap).
2. add a line such as the following to /etc/services (NB: 750 is not an
officially assigned port).

aabroad		750/udp		# async atalk broadcast

3. create an AppleTalk Net Number for each host that is to run asyncad and
add lines to /etc/atalkatab to map the network number to the host IP address.
(You must be using the modified atalkad.c available via ftp from munnari.OZ.AU)

170.26	A	128.250.1.26	unimelb-Async	# async net running on murtoa

4. add another entry to /etc/atalk.local to identify the Net Number and
Zone Name for Asynchronous AppleTalk on this host. This must be the fourth
non-comment line in the file, after the one that identifies the NIS host.

# asyncnet	asynczone
170.26		unimelb-Async

5. Add an entry to /etc/rc.local to run the daemon at boot time (it may be
necessary to put this line before 'portmap'. It is possible for portmap to
steal ports in this range).

/usr/local/cap/asyncad

6. On your Macintosh, install the 'Network' adev that normally comes with
the 'EtherTalk' driver. This software is available from Apple.

7. Copy 'Async AppleTalk' into the System Folder.

8. Connect a serial line to the Macintosh Modem Port and a modem/host port.

9. Open the Control Panel and select the ICON 'Async ATalk'. Choose a
serial line speed and 'Connect'. Follow the normal login procedure and run
/usr/local/cap/async. The login window will disappear. Selecting the
Chooser (probably twice consecutively on a Mac Plus at 1200 baud) should
show the normal AppleTalk services.

I recommend that at least System Sotware version 6 be used.
