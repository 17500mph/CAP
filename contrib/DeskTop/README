'dumpdt' dumps the content of the .IDeskTop and .ADeskTop files in the
specified CAP AUFS volume. usage:

	dumpdt volumename

ie:
	
	dumpdt ~/mac


'builddt' traverses the specified volume and builds new .IDeskTop and
.ADeskTop files based on the current volume contents. The -w flag must
be used explicitly to cause new .?DeskTop files to be written. The -q
flag sets 'quiet' mode, otherwise a message is printed for each file
examined. The -d flag can be used to obtain a verbose debug listing.

usage:

	builddt [ -d ] [ -w ] [ -q ] volumename

ie:

	builddt -w ~/mac

WARNING: The CAP .?DeskTop file contents are cached within running AUFS
processes.  To make effective changes for global volumes (afpvols specified
with the -V option), the parent AUFS server should be killed, the DeskTop
rebuilt and the server restarted.  For personal volumes, the volume should
be unmounted from all Macintoshes before the DeskTop is rebuilt.

WARNING: this is beta software. Run without -w and check the output
for sensible data first. Always keep copies of existing .?DeskTop files.
