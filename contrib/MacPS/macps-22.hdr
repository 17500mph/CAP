Subject: New version of macps/prepfix (2.2)

[Note to info-mac moderator: This version replaces the current version
in the info-mac/unix directory.  Thanks.  Ed]

I've just posted the latest version of macps & prepfix (2.2) to
comp.sources.unix and comp.sources.mac and it should soon be available
by anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, in the info-mac/unix
directory.  Here is a brief description:

Macps is a Unix program that takes an uploaded PostScript file created
on a Macintosh (by typing Command-F at the LaserWriter dialog box) and
includes an appropriately modified LaserPrep file so that the result
can be sent to a PostScript printer from Unix.  Since the Apple
LaserPrep files are copyrighted, I've included a program, prepfix, that
reads version 4.0 and up LaserPrep files, and edits them so that they
are compatible with macps, and are even electronically mailable.

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2

Version 2.2 of macps/prepfix adds support of LaserWriter 6.0, and contains
some minor bug fixes.  Printing under NeXT 1.0 to the NeXT laser printer
works well for LaserWriter 4.0 - 5.2 (except for the inherent problems
of printing patterns at 400 dpi), but under LaserWriter 6.0, some things
just don't print, and I don't know why (the exact same file prints fine
on a LaserWriter).
