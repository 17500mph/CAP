# aufs/AppleShareIP Address Access Filter List
#
# NB: The filter file format is compatible with that used by the ARNS
# Remote Access package (http://www.cs.mu.OZ.AU/appletalk/atalk.html)
#
# The filter list consists of a single character mode, an IP mask and
# optional IP address. If the latter is included, the mask is applied
# to the incoming IP address and tested against the provided address.
# Otherwise the incoming IP address must be unchanged by the mask.
#
# Modes:
#
# * IP_MASK [ IP_ADDR ]		permit access
# + IP_MASK [ IP_ADDR ]		permit access
# - IP_MASK [ IP_ADDR ]		deny access
#
#
# any mac on a specific subnet
+ 255.255.255.0    192.43.207.0
# connections from ariel
* 128.250.255.255  128.250.20.3
# anybody on campus
+ 128.243.255.255
# nobody else
