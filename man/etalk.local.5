.TH etalk.local 5 "27 February 1991" "Melbourne University"
.SH NAME
etalk.local \- configuration file for EtherTalk based CAP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The contents of etalk.local are "free format" with
keyword identifiers for each piece of information. The file is written by
both UAB and the Native Ethertalk AARP daemon aarpd
after they have identified the network, node and zone name.
If the file atalk.local exists, it
is used to "seed" values that are not otherwise obtained from the network.
.PP
The format of the file is quite simple. Each piece of information is
presented on a single line in the form "identifier <TAB> data". Comments
are identified with a '#' character at the beginning of the line. Note that
since the file is (re)written whenever UAB starts or when the Native
EtherTalk version of CAP identifies a new default router, comments added by
the user will not persist.
