% This file changes the parity setting of a serially-connected PostScript 
% printer to 8-bit, no parity, so that the upper 128 characters of a font
% (the special characters like bullets, diacritics, etc) will print and so
% binary data (usually color and gray-scale images produced by some programs)
% will also work.

% Change the 0 below to match the system administrator password of the printer
% (zero is the default)

% Change the 25 below to 9 if you are using the 9-pin serial connector
% instead of the 25-pin.

% Change the 9600 below if needed to match the baud rate of the serial
% connection (see the printer's user manual for appropriate values).
%
% The 3 below specifies 8-bit, no parity.
