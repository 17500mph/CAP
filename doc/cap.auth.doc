Authentication Methods

The file /etc/cap.auth specifies a network list (permit or deny)
on a per server per type (lwsrv, aufs) basis. Rules are additive
in that later rules can modify previous rules. The comments below
are for explanation only and should not be included in the file.
Examples:

lwsrv.*.innet	32.152 33.9	# For lwsrv of any name, only accept
				# connections from the listed networks.

lwsrv.PrivateLW.outnet	33.9	# Independent of other rules the
				# "PrivateLW" does not accept
				# connections from 33.9.

*.*.innet	32.152 33.9	# Any server with any name allows
				# only the listed networks.

*.*.innet	*		# Any server allows any network
				# (in reality deletes access list)

lwsrv.*.network    ImOK		# client mac must have NBP registered
				# X.Y.Z:ImOK where X.Y is net, Z node

To use authentication, you must define "AUTHENTICATE" in the features
list at Configuration time. It is suggested that you use only one of 
AUTHENTICATE and LWSRV_AUFS_SECURITY. The latter requires an lwsrv spooler
user to be concurrently connected to an aufs server on the same machine.
