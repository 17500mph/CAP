CAP GLOSSARY

CAP	Columbia AppleTalk Package
	A freeware suite of programs that partially implement the AppleTalk
	protocol stack on a variety of UNIX machines.  Includes an AFP 2.0
	AppleShare Server, LaserWriter Spooler and lpr/lpd "input" filter.

ETHERTALK
	AppleTalk protocols transmitted in specific type Ethernet packets.
	May be Phase 1 (Ethernet packets type 0x809B) or Phase 2 (IEEE 802.3
	Ethernet packets with 0xAAAA03 802.2 header and 0x080007809B SNAP
	headers).  CAP in "Native EtherTalk" mode uses AppleTalk in Ethernet.
	
LOCALTALK
	AppleTalk protocols transmitted over twisted pair cable at
	230.4Kbits/second.

IPTALK	IP encapsulated AppleTalk
	AppleTalk protocols transmitted within IP packets.  Usually used with
	CAP on UNIX hosts that are unable to speak EtherTalk.  Requires an
	external AppleTalk gateway to translate IPTalk to/from EtherTalk.
	
UAB	UNIX AppleTalk Bridge
	Phase 1 EtherTalk Router.  Used to connect two EtherTalk networks
	together via Ethernet interfaces on a UNIX host.  Also supports
	CAP processes via local UDP/IP loopback using modified IPTalk.
	Bundled with CAP.

UAR	UNIX AppleTalk Router
	Phase 1/Phase 2 EtherTalk Router for UNIX boxes.  Also supports CAP
	and simple AppleTalk tunneling over IP networks.  Not bundled with
	CAP.  Available in two versions: freeware with basic features and
	shareware with extra features (supports ARNS clients, NBP registry).

AUFS	AppleTalk UNIX File Server
	UNIX based AppleShare server.  Supports Apple Filing Protocol v 2.0.
	Nominated UNIX directories can be mounted as a AppleShare Volumes
	for storage of Mac files.

LWSRV	LaserWriter Server/Spooler
	UNIX based LaserWriter Spooler.  Macintosh print jobs are spooled to
	the UNIX printer queue for subsequent printing via PAPIF or serially
	connected printer.

PAPIF	PAP Input Filter
	BSD lpd filter for sending print-jobs to AppleTalk connected
	printers.  Can be used in a script for non-BSD printing systems.

AARPD	AARP Daemon
	UNIX process for handling AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol (AARP)
	lookups.  Stores ethernet hardware address/AppleTalk address mappings
	which are available to other CAP processes via RPC.  Also handles
	updating of /etc/etalk.local.  Used only with "Native EtherTalk".

ATIS	AppleTalk Information Server
	UNIX process for handling AppleTalk Name Binding Protocol (NBP)
	lookups and registrations, AppleTalk Echo Protocol (AEP) traffic
	and Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP) data.  Sends RTMP
	router updates to AARPD via RPC.  Other CAP processes register
	Chooser visible names with ATIS.

GETZONES
	List AppleTalk zones for the local Internet.

ATLOOK	AppleTalk Lookup
	Lists AppleTalk NBP entities visible on the network.  Also ATPINGER
	for sending Echo Protocol packets and ATLOOKLWS for LaserWriters.

SNITCH	UNIX InterPoll client
	Equivalent to Macintosh "Responder" program.  Provides limited
	information about the CAP host to Mac InterPoll lookups.
