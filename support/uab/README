Installation

This version of UAB has been incorporated into CAP. Run Configure in the
CAP top level directory and answer 'yes' to the using UAB question. The CAP
libraries will be set up for UAB use and UAB will be compiled and installed
automatically (in /usr/local/cap by default).

YOU MUST STILL MANUALLY EDIT AND INSTALL THE FILE "bridge_desc" (by default
this file is in /usr/local/lib/cap, unless the 'caplibdestdir' variable is
modified [for example, to "/etc/"] in m4.setup).

The file /etc/etalk.local is written by UAB when it discovers sufficient
information about the connected networks. CAP programs will use this
file to obtain network and bridge details.

Installation on Sony NEWS

1. make /dev/ether?

UAB for the Sony NEWS uses the rawether interface. To make the device file,

	% cd /dev; sh MAKEDEV ether0

2. run Configure

Ensure that Configure recognizes that it is running under NEWS. It will do
this automatically if the directory '/usr/sony/bin' exists, otherwise type
"newsos" for the Operating System type. Answer 'y' to the UAB question.

3. add the appropriate entry to the bridge_desc file ... EG:

ohio	[ELAP,/dev/ether:0]	mkip	[138.115,Mac-net]
