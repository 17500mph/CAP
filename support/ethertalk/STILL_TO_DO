Native EtherTalk
----------------

*** Still to do as of Feb 14th 1991

Test the supplied enet driver (../enet/* & senetp.c, easy, should just work).
Make the DLI interface work under ULTRIX (dlip.c, harder, socket problem ??).

Determine the need for locking of /etc/etalk.local during updates on nets
that suffer frequent changes of default bridge.

*** Already done:

Make the native SUN NIT interface (snitp.c) work.
